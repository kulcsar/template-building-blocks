# Template Building Blocks

The AzureCAT - patterns & practices (PnP) template building blocks project provides a series of Azure Resource Manager templates that you can use to deploy a collection of resources by providing only a parameter file. For more information, see the [building block template project wiki](https://github.com/mspnp/template-building-blocks/wiki).

> These templates are used in the [Reference architectures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/) guidance provided by the PnP team.
